# Wikipedia Data Dump Parser
This directory contains the source code of our parsing program. It is built using [bam](http://matricks.github.io/bam/). Unfortunately, the program is although very nice not terribly helpful for anyone at its current state. This is because it was written very specifically for **my** directory structure.
Steps are currently being taken to turn this parser into a more general purpose tool.
